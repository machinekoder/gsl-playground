  The HAL Remote protocol can be used to remotely interact with a HAL
  instance.

  <message name = "halrcomp bind">
    This message binds a HAL remote component to a HAL instance. If
    the local description of the HAL component matches the remote
    description the bind will be confirmend. In case the remote
    instance does not exist prior to the bind request it will be
    automatically created.

    In case the remote instance of the component does not match the
    description sent with the bind message, the bind request will be
    rejected.

    The *no_create* flag can be used to prevent the Haltalk server
    from creating a new remote component instance in case none exists.

  <message name = "halrcomp set">
    The set command is used to update pin values of remote component
    instances. Instead of the *name* field the *handle* field is used
    to address individual pins. Therefore, it is necessary to have a
    local description of the remote component before a set command can
    be issued.

    In case the *set* request can not be issued by the Haltalk instance a
    *set reject* message will be returned.
