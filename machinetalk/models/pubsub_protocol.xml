<class name = "Machinetalk Pub-Sub Protocol">
  The Machintalk Pub-Sub Protocol provides a realiable channel for
  Publish-Subscribe based interfaces.

  The Pub-Sub channel is unidirectional and therefore no realiable way
  to send message from subscriber to publisher exist. However, some
  transports provide notification about new subscribers starting to
  listen. Depending on the implementation a second channel might be
  necessary to request new full updates from the service.

  <message name = "full update">
    A full value update from the service. The full update synchronizes
    all values and therefore marks the values as synced. Any further
    updates to values are pushed using the incremental update.

    <field name = "pparams" message = "ProtcolParameters" requirement = "MAY" quantity = "1">
      <field name = "keepalive_timer" requirement = "MUST" />
    </field>

  </message>

  <message name = "incremental update">
    The incremental update message contains incremental value
    updates. If a incremental update is missed a new full update needs
    to be requested in order to get a consistent state.
